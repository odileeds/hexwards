# Leeds Hexagon Ward Map

A hexagon-based map of Leeds wards that displays data from the Leeds Data Mill. When provided with a Database ID for the Data Mill it calls the API (if it exists) and gets the data. If a main category column title and ward column title are provided it will calculate the data for a ward and display it as a heat map.
